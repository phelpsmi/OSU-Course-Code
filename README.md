This is a complilation of all the code I made while taking classes at Oregon State University

The terms I took these courses are as follows:

CS161: Winter - 2014 with Jennifer Parham-Mocello

CS162: Spring - 2014 with Jennifer Parham-Mocello
CS262: Fall   - 2014 with Terry Rooker

CS275: Fall   - 2014 , can't remember professor name (course work is stored in public_html directory)

The next year of courses involved lots of group work that I won't put in this respository (Also a haskel class but really who gives a shit about that)

CS344: Winter - 2016, Benjamin Brewster

PS, if Erwig tries to say that Programming Language Fundamentals is a class where you learn concepts that also happens to have haskel then he's bullshiting you. It's a haskel class which happens to involve some higher level concepts.
